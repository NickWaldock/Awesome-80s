# Introduction & Aims
The 'Awesome 80s Drum Machine!' is an 80s inspired interactive music making platorm. This site is a fun and engaging throwback to the sounds of the 80s and the sounds that defined a generation of music. 
This site was created to utilise the language of JavaScript and demonstrate user interactivity in a musical context. During this site the user is able to mix and match numerous drum sounds to create unique drum grooves at different speeds. This project represents my second major project with Code Institute.
<br>
<br>
This site is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

## Aims
- To create a site with a HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity
- To utilise functional and simple design concepts for an easy-to-navigate UX
- Responsive design for accessability on all devices
- Incorporate audio manipulation in an interactive context
- Be visually striking
- Simple to follow instructions
- Be fun and engaging!

# User Experience
## User Stories
### As a first time visitor, I want to:
- Be able to easily comprehend the instructions for the game, know how to interact with the site and easily find the interactive elements
- Be able to view the instructions again after commencing the game if required
- Be able to change the speed of the playback
<br />
<br />

### As a returning visitor, I want to:
- Be able to explore the range of sounds and combinations of user choices
- Enjoy making music!
- Be able to play the game on different devices
<br />
<br />

# Main Features
## Main Inspiration & Design
The site was inspired by the western pop culture of the 1980s and contains features of the decade such as early arcade style typograpy, bright neon contrasting colors, bold and simple layouts and borders, and a retro-futuristic background.

## Features
- An introductory screen with consise and easy to follow instructions on how the game works
- A 'Let's Go!' button to transition to the game area
- 3 distinct areas for the game elements: The clickable icons, the layer indicators, and the control buttons
- Large icons as clickable elements that play the associated sounds on click
-  Layer indicatiors that light up and visually show the number of choices made (to a max of 16) when a user input is chosen.
- Control buttons: 
    - Kit - to change the sound set; 
    - BPM - to chose the speed to playback
    - Reset - to reset the users choices
    - Play! - to play the chosen samples
    - Stop - to stop playing the audio
<br />
